One row per generation I **kept or seriously considered**. Rejections stay in
here too, as thumbnails in `design/rejected/` — Assignment 2 says graders read
them, and the instructor's note says a screenshot of the prompt and result plus
one line of reasoning is a valid entry without spending a download.

**Download discipline.** Suno's free plan allows **7 downloads for the life of
the account and they never reset**. Listening and rejecting happens in the
browser. Only a finalist is downloaded. The counter below is maintained by hand
so I can see what is left.

| Suno downloads used | Remaining |
|---|---|
| **0** | **7** |

**Eight tracks generated on 2026-10-01 across two directions, every one of them
auditioned in the browser, and zero downloaded.** A third direction was rejected
from its prompt without being generated at all. Model: `v6-mini` for the four
usable tracks, `V6 PREVIEW` for four that came back capped at 1:00 behind an
upgrade button.

## Music

**Evidence:** `design/rejected/2026-10-01-suno-library.png` — a screenshot of
the Suno workspace listing all eight tracks with their prompts, durations and
model tags. The prompts below are transcribed from that listing, which is
Suno's own record of what was sent, not from what I meant to send.

**Reproducibility, stated honestly.** Suno exposes no seed, so these rows
reproduce the *request* and not the output: the same prompt will not return the
same audio. That is a limitation of the tool, not of the log, and it is why the
sound effects are planned for a model that does record a seed. The finalist will
be identified by its file hash once it is in the project.

**A constraint discovered by running it.** Four of the eight tracks came back
tagged `V6 PREVIEW` and capped at 1:00 with an "Upgrade for full song" button.
Those are not usable assets on the free tier regardless of how they sound, so
the real candidate pool is the four `v6-mini` tracks.

### Direction B — driving, 124 bpm — *accepted*

The prompt Claude wrote was used **verbatim**, four times, unchanged:

> `driving 124 bpm, pulsing bass with tight muted percussion, urgent and forward-moving, loop for a side-scrolling platformer, metal walkways and machinery, near-future industrial, no vocals, seamless loop`

Suno auto-titled all four **"Metal Walkways"** from the prompt.

| Asset ID | Model | Length | Usable? | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MUS-B-01` | `v6-mini` | **1:54** | yes | **Finalist.** Not yet downloaded. |
| `MUS-B-02` | `v6-mini` | **1:42** | yes | **Finalist.** Not yet downloaded. |
| `MUS-B-03` | `V6 PREVIEW` | 1:00 | **no** — paywalled | unusable on the free tier |
| `MUS-B-04` | `V6 PREVIEW` | 1:00 | **no** — paywalled | unusable on the free tier |

Accepted as the direction on hearing it: *"很激情…能衬托出紧张感调动玩家肾上腺素"* —
passionate, and it sets off the tension. Judged against `CONCEPT.md` revision
1.1. **One of `MUS-B-01` / `MUS-B-02` still has to be chosen and downloaded**,
then cut at a bar boundary, checked across ≥3 repetitions for a seam, and
exported as OGG. None of that has happened; the slice still has no music.

### 2026-10-04 — the file is in the project

**How.** A single-download pack was purchased. The free-tier wall described in
the correction above was not circumvented and nothing was screen-recorded; the
download was paid for. **The exact licence terms of that pack have not been
read yet** and are an open item for `SOURCES.md` — they are not assumed to be
the same as the free tier's personal-use grant, and they are not assumed to be
broader either.

**Which track.** `MUS-B-02`, identified by duration: the downloaded file is
101.614 s (1:41.6), and the library screenshot lists `MUS-B-02` at 1:42.

| | |
|---|---|
| Source file | `Metal Walkways.mp3`, 2 625 278 bytes, mp3 48 kHz stereo ~207 kbps |
| Source SHA-256 | `052baa0989785b7fa30126062ff7dd0bf07d6b5621b9a76c08234ae59ac06f8d` |
| Downloads used | **1** (paid pack; the free lifetime 7 were already spent before this project) |

**Measured, not assumed.** Tempo was recovered from the audio rather than taken
from the prompt: a spectral-flux onset envelope, autocorrelated for the beat
period, then refined by a comb search over period and phase.

| | measured |
|---|---|
| Tempo | **124.018 BPM** (beat 0.483800 s) |
| Bar (4/4) | 1.935200 s |
| First downbeat | 0.69380 s |
| Downbeats in the track | 52 |

**The prompt asked for 124 bpm and the track is 124.02.** Worth recording
because the coarse first pass read 125.00 exactly — that was the
autocorrelation's bin resolution (10.7 ms), not the music. The refined number
is the one in the table.

**The loop.** Three candidates were cut at bar boundaries and scored for
spectral continuity across the splice plus level match. The chosen one is the
best of the three on both counts:

| | start | bars | length | seam rank |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A — chosen** | 29.722 s | 16 | **30.9632 s** | **10th percentile** |
| B | 41.333 s | 20 | 38.7040 s | 22nd percentile |
| C | 49.074 s | 16 | 30.9632 s | 33rd percentile |

A 20 ms equal-power crossfade is applied at the wrap: the 20 ms *following* the
loop end is blended into the loop's head, so the last sample flows into the
first.

**How "seam rank" was measured, because "it sounds fine" is not a check.** The
loop was concatenated three times and a frame-to-frame spectral-difference
curve computed over the whole thing. The two internal seams are then ranked
against every other moment in the same audio. Loop A's seams sit at the **10th
and 8th percentile** — the wrap changes the spectrum *less* than 90 % of
ordinary moments in the music do. The raw waveform discontinuity at the wrap is
0.00247, against a largest ordinary sample-to-sample step of 0.33545 in the same
file — **136× smaller**.

| | |
|---|---|
| In the project | `godot/assets/music-loop.ogg`, Vorbis q5, 595 009 bytes |
| Loop SHA-256 | `ea52713afeef1cacdae6ee9b5fe9789ff266c57f7e2b9c6d6380b1e1a85db865` |

**Wired into the game, 2026-10-04 (later).** `CHANGE-BRIEF.md` revision 2.2.0:
an `AudioStreamPlayer` on a dedicated `Music` bus, `loop = true`, starting with
the session and surviving every retry without restarting. Eight behavioural
checks cover it; the engine reports the stream length as 30.9632091522217 s,
which is the cut in the table above.

**Still owed:** the human listen. `CHANGE-BRIEF.md` C4 requires playing the loop
three times back to back and listening at the seam *before* it goes near the
project. The file was placed first and the listen is outstanding — recorded that
way round rather than claimed in the right order. The 30.96 s length is also
short of the 35–40 s the original prompt asked for; that was a request to the
generator, not a requirement of the game, and loop A won on seam quality.

### Direction A — sparse, 85 BPM — *rejected*

**The four prompts here were all reworded, and none of them is the prompt
Claude supplied.** Whether I edited them or Suno's prompt enhancement expanded
them is not something the screenshot settles, so it is **not asserted either
way**. What the library records is below, verbatim. Suno auto-titled all four
**"Cold Overhead Light"**.

| Asset ID | Model | Length | Prompt as the library records it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MUS-A-01` | `v6-mini` | 3:08 | `Near-future industrial, seamless looping production with brushed-metal textures and cold overhead-light sheen, slow stately 85 BPM, instrumental, muted synth pads layered into a full dense bed with sparse plucked arpeggios` |
| `MUS-A-02` | `v6-mini` | 2:49 | `Instrumental near-future industrial game-loop music, driving urgent pulse with a seamless 85 BPM feel, dense muted synth pads and interlocking plucked arpeggios over brushed-metal percussion, cold overhead-light textures, spacious mix that loops cleanly` |
| `MUS-A-03` | `V6 PREVIEW` | 1:00 | `Near-future industrial ambient, muted synth pads and sparse plucked arpeggio layered into a full, dense arrangement, instrumental, laid-back 85 BPM pulse, brushed-metal textures and cold, spacious production with a seamless loop` |
| `MUS-A-04` | `V6 PREVIEW` | 1:00 | `Near-future industrial, muted synth pads and sparse plucked arpeggio gradually joined by brushed-metal percussion and low synth bass, instrumental, seamless loop with a restrained cold sheen, unhurried mid-tempo 85 BPM build from near-silence to a full arrangement` |

**All four rejected**, auditioned in the browser, none downloaded. Rejected
against revision 1.1's driving direction: this direction leaves the player
room, and the score is supposed to supply the pressure.

**Worth recording as a finding:** direction A got **four attempts with four
different wordings** — including `MUS-A-02`, which asked for a "driving urgent
pulse" at 85 BPM and so was already drifting toward direction B — and still
lost. Direction B won on the **first wording, used verbatim**. More prompt
iteration did not rescue a direction that was wrong for the game; the decision
that mattered was which feeling the score should carry, not how the sentence
was phrased.

### Direction C — cold industrial ambient — *never generated*

| Asset ID | Model | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `MUS-C-00` | **not generated** | **Rejected at the prompt stage.** *"第三个从文字描述上就提不起我的兴趣"* — the written description did not interest me. Cost: one unused daily credit, zero downloads. |

Recorded because deciding *not* to spend a generation is a judgement, and the
free daily credits do not carry over.

## Sound effects

> **These four are NOT generated assets, and they do not satisfy the
> assignment's "generate sound" requirement.** They are synthesised by
> arithmetic in `scripts/synth_placeholder_sfx.py` -- closed-form waveforms
> plus one seeded noise array -- and they are placeholders in exactly the sense
> `godot/assets/README.md` already uses for the death reaction. The generated
> versions replace them file-for-file; the wiring, the triggers and the
> assertions below do not change when they do.

**Why they exist at all, rather than waiting for the generator.** `CONCEPT.md`
revision 1.1 made a prediction and `CHANGE-BRIEF.md` C4 turned it into a check:
*the trap's 15-frame warning is masked by a 124 bpm bed with pulsing bass, so
the hazard reads as unfair with sound on even though it is fair with sound
off.* That check is perceptual, it needs a human ear, and **it cannot be run
against silence.** With these in place it can be run today and re-run against
the generated versions, which makes the two comparable instead of sequential.

| Asset ID | Source | Length | Design brief it answers | Where it fires |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SFX-JUMP` | `synth_placeholder_sfx.py`, seed 727001 | 0.110 s | rising pitch = leaving the ground | `player.jumps` increments |
| `SFX-SLASH` | same | 0.140 s | band-passed air with a falling centre; the blade is already a visible arc, so the sound carries direction | `player.attacks` increments |
| `SFX-TRAP` | same | 0.260 s | **rising inharmonic metallic sweep** -- see below | the tick `trap_risen[i]` leaves 0 |
| `SFX-DEATH` | same | 0.450 s | low thud, burst, descending minor third; the only long one, because the retry is 0.55 s | the fatal contact |

### `SFX-TRAP` is the one with an argument behind it

Revision 1.1 did not just predict the masking, it specified the answer in
advance: the warning wants **a moving pitch, which percussion does not have**,
so it is told apart by motion rather than by level. So:

- partials at **inharmonic ratios 1, 1.41, 1.93, 2.57** -- struck metal, not a
  musical note the score could swallow
- the fundamental sweeps **420 Hz -> 2100 Hz**
- amplitude **rises** across the sound rather than decaying: the hazard is still
  arriving, so the warning should not be fading
- **0.260 s = 15.6 frames at 60 Hz** -- the sound lasts the warning

### Levels

Per-sound trim on a dedicated `Sfx` bus: jump −7 dB, slash −5 dB, **trap
0 dB**, death −2 dB. The trap is loudest deliberately: it is the only one of
the four the player is supposed to *act* on.

**And the mix needed a limiter.** The music loop peaks at 0.702 and `SFX-TRAP`
at 0.810 after its trim, so an aligned pair sums to **1.512** — half again over
full scale. Turning the music down does not fix it (even −9 dB leaves 1.059),
so the music carries **−3 dB** of headroom and an `AudioEffectHardLimiter` sits
on Master at a −0.5 dB ceiling. On a 14-second test with the trap fired three
times over the loop at the game's levels, the limiter touches **9 samples out
of 672 000**. Found by building an offline mix to run the masking check — not
by playing, where a few clipped samples inside a 0.26 s sweep go unnoticed.
`CHANGE-BRIEF.md` revision 2.4.1.

### Reproducibility, and a claim I had to walk back

Re-running the script produces **byte-identical WAVs**. It does **not** produce
byte-identical OGGs, and the script's first docstring said it did. An Ogg page
header carries a stream serial number that ffmpeg picks at random and exposes
no flag to pin.

What is identical is the audio: decoding two runs' OGGs to raw PCM gives a
byte-for-byte match on all four. That was **checked, not assumed** -- the exact
commands are in the script's docstring. So the reproducible artefact is the
waveform, and an OGG's hash fingerprints one particular encode rather than the
sound.

### What is still owed on the generated versions

A generator that **records a seed**, which is the requirement `CHARACTER-SHEET.md`
section 8 has carried since the Suno music turned out to be unreproducible, and
which the correction dated 2026-10-04 made binding rather than preferred. The
prompts go in this table when they are run, verbatim as the tool records them --
the same discipline the music section had to be rebuilt to follow.

## Art

### The seed requirement was broken on purpose, and here is the reasoning

`CHARACTER-SHEET.md` section 8 has carried "the generator must record a seed"
as a preference since the start, and the correction dated 2026-10-04 made it
**binding** after Suno turned out to expose none — which left the music
reproducible as a *request* and not as an *output*.

**`CHAR-REF-01` was generated on a tool that records no seed.** That is a
deliberate departure from my own rule, taken after five attempts on a tool
that does record one failed to produce a usable frame. The cost is real and
unchanged: this asset reproduces as a request, not as an output. What is
recorded instead is the exact instruction text and the file's hash.

Writing it down rather than quietly switching is the point. The rule was right;
it lost to a worse problem.

### Attempts on Civitai — five generations, none usable

| # | Model | Prompt summary | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Z Image Turbo` + **`8bitdiffuser 64x`** LoRA (SD 1.5), **TO CONFIRM: checkpoint, seed** | the full `CHARACTER-SHEET` prompt, ~60 words | **Rejected.** Produced a front **and** back turnaround of a tall, realistic-proportioned figure. Two characters in one frame, no side view, roughly 8 heads tall — at a 28 px figure height that leaves a 3 px head |
| 2 | same | shortened, `side profile facing right`, `three and a half heads tall` | **Rejected.** Back view on a stone pedestal, dark background, no scarf, no visor. Almost nothing in the prompt survived |
| 3 | **`2D Pixel Toolkit`**, `((Side view)), full body, solid background` | 15 words | **Rejected, but the first useful failure.** Side view ✓, chibi proportions ✓, facing right ✓, white background ✓ — and anime hair instead of a helm, with the purple landing on the hair rather than a scarf |
| 4 | same | added `full face helmet, glowing cyan visor slit, no hair` | **Rejected.** The colour words fought: `glowing cyan` and `navy blue armor` averaged into an all-cyan creature at 2 heads tall. `no hair` pushed it away from a humanoid entirely |
| 5 | — | — | not spent; the budget decision below was taken first |

**What those four cost and what they bought.** 40 Buzz of a 100 Buzz balance —
**four of ten available generations** — which is why the remaining budget could
not have covered eight poses at ten Buzz each even if attempt 4 had worked.
What they bought is the diagnosis: these LoRAs are trained on front-facing
anime figures, so "side view" is fought rather than followed, and a 60-word
prompt dilutes the one token that matters past the 77-token limit. Attempt 3
is the evidence — it is the one where the prompt got short enough.

**Screenshots: TO CAPTURE** → `design/rejected/2026-10-05-civitai-*.png`.

### `CHAR-REF-01` — accepted

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | **GPT-6**, as I reported it. An instruction-following image model rather than a diffusion UI, which is why its instruction was written as prose with hard requirements instead of comma-separated tags. Recorded as reported — I did not verify the version string myself. |
| Seed | **none exposed.** See the note above |
| Licence | **STILL TO CONFIRM.** The last open provenance question in the project. |
| File | `design/character/CHAR-REF-01.png`, 1254 × 1254 |
| SHA-256 | `7bc5e6428fec00e3107bf5fb9b2df141657ebe6d8263933492510a7984841971` |

The instruction was written as prose with hard requirements rather than as
comma-separated tags, which is what the tool responds to:

> Side view, strict profile, facing RIGHT. Not front, not back, not 3/4. Chibi
> proportions, about 3.5 heads tall, large head, stocky body. A ninja in deep
> navy blue plate armour. Full head covering — a dark navy hood/helm. NO hair,
> NO visible face, NO eyes. Just a thin glowing light-blue horizontal slit
> across where the eyes would be. A long purple scarf trailing behind him.
> Pale steel gauntlets and boots. The far-side arm and leg must be painted a
> DARKER navy than the near-side arm and leg, so the limbs read as separate.
> Limited palette, hard pixel edges, no gradients, no anti-aliasing, no glow.
> Plain solid white background. Single character only. No text, no weapon, no
> pedestal, no shadow.

**Accepted on the first attempt**, against the four it took elsewhere. Every
identity item is present: side profile facing right, full hood with no hair and
no face, the light-blue visor slit, the purple scarf, navy plate, steel
gauntlets and boots, plain white background, single character, no weapon.

### Edits, and one that is not optional

`scripts/import_pose.py` is run on every pose. It finds the figure, scales it
to the collider's height, places it on the (20, 30) anchor, and **snaps every
pixel to the eight-colour palette**.

**It also adds the directional rim, and that is an edit worth being explicit
about.** `CHARACTER-SHEET.md` section 3c requires 1 px of `steel_edge` toward
the character's back and 1 px up, because the dungeon's light is a torch above
and behind. The generated reference came back with a near-black outline
instead, which snaps to `shade` — 1.14:1 against the wall, which is to say
nothing at all.

Measured on `CHAR-REF-01`, at the real game size:

| | without the rim | with it |
|---|---|---|
| figure reading at 3:1 or better against the wall | **6.3 %** | **24.2 %** |
| `steel_edge` pixels | 20 | 94 (74 added) |
| rim check | WARN — nothing on the back edge | ok |

(The shipped code-drawn character measures 9.1 % on the same test.)

A model cannot be relied on to place a one-pixel light edge correctly at a
28 px figure height. Doing it in the importer is deterministic, identical for
every pose, and derived from the same rule the code already uses — but it is
**an edit to a generated asset**, not a property of the generation, and the
distinction matters for anyone reading this log to find out what the model
actually produced.

### `CHAR-P1` … `CHAR-P8` — all eight accepted

Generated from `CHAR-REF-01` supplied back as a reference image, one pose per
request, with the same opening sentence every time — *same character, same
style, same palette, same size, same white background, side view facing right*
— and a single pose line appended. Same model as the reference, same absence of
a seed.

| ID | pose line | imported as | visor px | reads at 3:1+ against the wall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CHAR-P1` | standing still, weight even, scarf settled | `p1-idle` | 8 | 24.0 % |
| `CHAR-P2` | mid-stride running, leaning forward, scarf streaming back, arms swinging opposite to the legs | `p2-run` | 8 | 25.5 % |
| `CHAR-P3` | airborne rising, far knee bent and lifted, scarf hanging below and behind | `p3-rising` | 7 | 25.6 % |
| `CHAR-P4` | airborne falling, legs reaching down, scarf blown above and behind | `p4-falling` | 8 | 28.8 % |
| `CHAR-P5` | horizontal dash, body level with no vertical lean, scarf fully extended straight back | `p5-dash` | 6 | 27.6 % |
| `CHAR-P6` | arm raised up and back, body coiled, about to strike, empty hand, NO weapon | `p6-windup` | 6 | 26.4 % |
| `CHAR-P7` | arm swept down and forward through a strike, body committed, empty hand, NO weapon | `p7-live` | 9 | 24.4 % |
| `CHAR-P8` | lying face down flat on the ground, head to the right, limbs collapsed, seen from the side | `p8-death` | 6 | 29.5 % |

**Accepted on the first attempt, all eight.** Every one is side-on facing
right, on a plain white background, with the hood, the visor slit, the purple
scarf and the steel extremities intact, and **none of the two attack poses
contains a sword** — which was the constraint most likely to be lost, because
the blade and the kill hitbox are built from the same three numbers and a blade
baked into a sprite would stop tracking it silently.

Automated checks on all eight: the feet land on row 30 of 30 in every pose,
contrast against the wall runs 24.0–29.5 % against a 6 % floor (the shipped
code-drawn character measures 9.1 %), and the rim reaches the back edge
everywhere.

`p5-dash` and `p8-death` are imported with `--prone`, which scales by **width**
instead of height, because both are laid out across rather than up. `p8-death`
ends up 11 px tall and 26 wide — the only pose in the game wider than it is
tall, which is the property `CONCEPT.md` revision 1.4 relies on.

### Edits — a second one, and the fix it needed

Beyond the directional rim described above, the importer **restores the visor
through the downscale**, and the reason is measured rather than assumed.

The slit is 1–2 px tall once the figure is 28 px high. An area resample
averages it into the navy helm, the result snaps to `plate`, and it disappears:
**0 visor pixels in seven of the first eight imports, 1 in the eighth.** That
is not cosmetic. Section 3b has the visor at 12.12:1 against the wall, the
strongest colour the character has, and section 5 makes it the reason facing is
readable from the head alone.

So the visor mask is taken from the **source** image before any scaling, then
resampled by area coverage and thresholded low, so a target pixel covering even
a sliver of slit stays a slit. Restored: 6–9 px per pose.

**The first version of that fix was wrong, and the way it was wrong is worth
keeping.** Bright highlights on the steel boots also snap to `glint`, so
restoring everything put stray cyan specks at the feet of `p1-idle` and
`p6-windup` — which reads as a rendering bug rather than as armour. The obvious
guard, "only the top 45 % of the figure", **silently zeroed `p8-death`**: in the
prone pose the head is at the *right*, not the top, and the top 45 % is scarf.
Taking the largest connected component of the source mask instead keeps the
slit, drops the specks, and does not care which way the character is lying.

Both of these are **edits to generated assets, not properties of the
generation**. What the model produced is a visor slit in a 1254 px image; what
the importer does is keep it alive at 28 px.

### Still owed

- **The licence terms of the model that generated the art.** Model and version
  are recorded now; its terms are not. Last open provenance question here.
- ~~The Civitai rejection screenshots.~~ **Done, 2026-10-06** — three of four,
  in `design/rejected/`. The fourth had already aged out of Civitai's 30-day
  generator history.

## Rejected, logged without downloading

| Date | Asset ID | Screenshot | Why rejected (against which pillar / sheet item) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-01 | `MUS-A-01` … `MUS-A-04` | `design/rejected/2026-10-01-suno-library.png` (all eight tracks, prompts and model tags in one listing) | Too much room. Against CONCEPT revision 1.1's driving direction — the score supplies the pressure, and this direction does not. Four wordings tried; none rescued it. |
| 2026-10-01 | `MUS-B-03`, `MUS-B-04` | same screenshot | Right direction, but `V6 PREVIEW` capped them at 1:00 behind an upgrade button. Rejected on availability, not on sound. |
| 2026-10-01 | `MUS-C-00` | n/a — never generated | Rejected from the written prompt alone; it did not interest me. Recorded because *deciding not to spend a generation* is a judgement, and the daily free credits do not carry over. |
