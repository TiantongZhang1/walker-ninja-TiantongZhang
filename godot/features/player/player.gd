## The rim colour. steel_edge, already in the eight-colour palette, so the

const RIM := Color("9aa7bd")

## The rim is DIRECTIONAL: 1 px toward the character's back and 1 px up, and
## nothing on the front or the underside.
##
## Revision 1.4 changed this, and the reason is arithmetic rather than taste. A
## rim grown on all four sides costs a part 2 px of width, so a 3 px arm keeps
## 1 px of armour and a 4 px leg keeps 2. Rendered, the limbs came out as grey
## pipes with a hint of navy down the middle -- the value scheme that is
## supposed to separate near limb from far limb had almost nowhere to happen.
## Growing in one direction only costs 0 px of width and still breaks the
## silhouette against the wall, because the light in a dungeon comes from a
## torch above and behind, not from everywhere.
##
## x is forward, so `x - 1` is toward the back for both facings: `_mrect`
## mirrors it. The rim therefore stays on the same side of the body when the
## character turns around, which is what a light source does and an outline
## does not.

## The body, back to front, as data. Both the rim pass and the paint pass walk
## this one array, so they cannot describe different characters.
##
## Entry shapes: [0, colour, rim, x, y, w, h] for a rect,
##               [1, colour, rim, points]     for a polygon.
## x is measured FORWARD from the body centre; `_mrect`/`_mpoly` mirror it when
## facing left. `rim` marks the parts that form the OUTER silhouette; interior
## detail is false and gets no halo.
##
## Revision 1.4 (CONCEPT): limbs, torso and head are separable. At 18 x 28 that
## cannot be done with gaps -- a 1 px rim closes any gap narrow enough to fit
## here -- so it is done with VALUE. Three steps, and every part belongs to
## exactly one:
##
##   shade  #16233d  the far side of the body, plus the recessed abdomen, the
##                   jawline and the neck
##   plate  #1f3a6e  the near side: chest, near arm, near leg
##   steel  #4a5468  the extremities only -- gauntlets and boots
##
## So the near limbs read against the torso, the far limbs read against the
## near limbs, and the hands and feet read against the limbs they end. None of
## it depends on a gap surviving a rim.
##
## Limb widths are 4 px (legs) and 3 px (arms). The first attempt used 2.5-3 px
## and an all-sides rim, which left 1 px of armour inside a 3 px arm; the rim
## is directional now (see `_mrect_o`) so the full width survives and the value
## step has somewhere to happen.

	# under everything; the body paints over its middle and only the rim
	# survives. The colour is steel_edge, already one of the eight -- 7.31:1
	# against the wall and 4.57:1 against the plate, so it reads against the
	# background AND against the body it outlines.

	# put a light edge around the visor, the belt and the abdomen as well, and
	# on a 3 px limb a 1 px halo on each side leaves 1 px of armour: the figure
	# came out looking like grey pipework. Interior detail is separated by
