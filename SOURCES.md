# SOURCES.md — where everything in this repository came from

Every file is in exactly one of four categories: **starter code**, **original
work**, **generated**, or **placeholder**. If a row says "generated", it names
the model. If it says "placeholder", it says what replaces it and when.

Nothing here is traced from, prompted against, or derived from a named artist,
a copyrighted character, a brand, or an existing recording. **No credential,
API key or token is in this repository or its history.**

| Version this document describes | the tip of `main` |
| Tracked files | 135 |
| Last revised | 2026-10-06 |

**This file is kept CURRENT, and that is deliberately different from the other
documents here.** `CONCEPT.md`, `CHANGE-BRIEF.md`, `ASSET-LOG.md` and
`FRICTIONAL.md` are append-only: revisions are added and earlier text is never
rewritten, so the record of what was believed when still stands. This one
answers *where did each file come from, right now*, and a stale answer to that
is worse than no answer. So it gets edited in place.

Revised 2026-10-06 because it had gone wrong: it still said "no art has been
generated" and "every pixel the game draws is original geometry written in
GDScript" after the character had been replaced with generated sprites. Both
sentences were true when written on 2026-10-05 and false a day later. The
history of what changed and when is in `ASSET-LOG.md` and `CHANGE-BRIEF.md`;
this file is only the current state.

## 1. Starter code

**Nik Bear Brown's `walker-jumpman` — "First Steps".** The course starter. The
movement model is his: speed 160, jump −320, gravity 960, terminal velocity
480, coyote 6 ticks, jump buffer 6 ticks. Those eight numbers are
**deliberately unchanged** and `godot/features/player/tuning.gd` says so in a
comment at the point they are declared.

Reached here through **`walker-jumpman-TiantongZhang`** at commit `d1a52cd` —
my own Assignment 1 extension of that starter, at
<https://github.com/TiantongZhang1/walker-jumpman-TiantongZhang>. The double
jump, the air dash, the sword, the fork, the pop-up traps and the patrolling
enemies are from that project and are mine.

**Two files from Assignment 1 were deliberately not copied forward**: the death
reaction's meme cat image and the laugh taken from a personal video. Both are
third-party content with no documented permission. They were shipped in
Assignment 1 as a considered decision; they are **absent from this
repository's entire history**, not merely deleted from its tip, and are
represented by the placeholders in section 4.

## 2. Original work — mine, not generated

### The visual art that is NOT generated

Everything in this table is original geometry written in GDScript — nothing
imported, traced or generated. The relevant code is
`godot/game/session.gd::_draw()` / `_draw_alcove()` / `_draw_torch()` /
`_draw_spikes()` / `_draw_enemies()`, and `player.gd::_draw_swing()` /
`_body_parts()`.

| | |
|---|---|
| Dungeon | stone wall, staggered mortar courses, blind arches, wall torches, platforms with a torchlit top edge |
| Hazards and enemies | spikes, slimes, flying horses |
| HUD | bands, cards, progress bar, labels |
| **The character's blade** | sheathed and swung, deliberately still code-drawn — see below |
| The character's **fallback** body | `_body_parts()`, still live and still tested, used when `godot/assets/poses/` is absent |

**The character the player normally sees is generated art** — eight sprites in
`godot/assets/poses/`. Section 3 has their provenance.

**The blade is code-drawn on purpose, and this is the one place in the project
where that distinction carries weight.** It comes from `ATTACK_PIVOT`,
`attack_angle()` and `tuning.attack_reach` — the same three numbers the kill
hitbox is built from — so the generated poses were prompted with *"empty hand,
NO weapon"*. A blade baked into a sprite would stop tracking the hitbox the
moment anyone touched the tuning, and **nothing would report it**: the two
`attack-hitbox-on-the-blade-*` checks would still pass, because they measure
the hitbox against the numbers rather than against the picture.

The eight-colour palette is recorded with measured contrast ratios in
`CHARACTER-SHEET.md` sections 3, 3b and 3c.

**On the character's history.** The first sketch request named a character from
a commercial game. That was refused on rights grounds *before anything was
drawn*, and the design that exists was specified instead by colour and
silhouette — deep blue body, light-blue horizontal visor slit, purple scarf.
`CONCEPT.md` section "What this replaces, and what it credits" carries the
record.

### Design documents

`CONCEPT.md`, `CHARACTER-SHEET.md`, `CHANGE-BRIEF.md`, `STORYBOARD.md`,
`ASSET-LOG.md`, `FRICTIONAL.md`, this file, and `TEST-REPORT.md`. Written for
this project. Append-only: revisions are added, earlier text is not rewritten,
and corrections are left standing above the thing they correct.

### The storyboard sketches

`design/storyboard/sheet-2026-10-03.jpg` and the seven crops beside it.
**Hand-drawn in pen by me on 2026-10-03**, photographed, and cropped by script.
Not generated and not traced.

### The sound effects

`godot/assets/sfx-{jump,slash,trap,death}.ogg`. Synthesised by
`scripts/synth_placeholder_sfx.py` — closed-form waveforms plus one noise array
seeded at 727001. **Original, and also not generated**: see section 4, because
for the purposes of this assignment they are placeholders.

### Evidence

`evidence/screens/*.png` are **real rendered viewport captures** written by
`godot/tests/capture_game.gd`, `capture_character.gd` and `capture_enemies.gd`.
`evidence/screens/char-contact-sheet.png` is assembled from those frames by
`scripts/build_char_sheet.py`; the 18 × 28 collider rectangle on it is an
annotation drawn by that script, not something the game renders.
`evidence/*.json` are written by the test runs themselves.

## 3. Generated

### `godot/assets/music-loop.ogg`

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | **Suno `v6-mini`** |
| Asset ID in `ASSET-LOG.md` | `MUS-B-02`, identified by duration (101.614 s against the library's 1:42) |
| Run on | suno.com, in a browser, free tier |
| Seed | **none — Suno exposes no seed.** The prompt reproduces the request, not the output |
| Prompt, verbatim as Suno's library records it | `driving 124 bpm, pulsing bass with tight muted percussion, urgent and forward-moving, loop for a side-scrolling platformer, metal walkways and machinery, near-future industrial, no vocals, seamless loop` |

| Source file | `Metal Walkways.mp3`, 2 625 278 bytes, SHA-256 `052baa0989785b7fa30126062ff7dd0bf07d6b5621b9a76c08234ae59ac06f8d` |
| In the project | 16 bars from 29.722 s, 30.9632 s long, 20 ms equal-power crossfade at the wrap, Vorbis q5, SHA-256 `ea52713afeef1cacdae6ee9b5fe9789ff266c57f7e2b9c6d6380b1e1a85db865` |
| Measured from the audio | 124.018 BPM, bar 1.9352 s, first downbeat 0.6938 s |

**My own edits:** tempo recovered from the audio rather than taken from the
prompt (spectral-flux onset envelope, autocorrelated, refined by a comb search
over period and phase); three candidate loops cut at bar boundaries and scored
for spectral continuity across the splice plus level match; the chosen one
crossfaded at the wrap. Method and numbers in `ASSET-LOG.md` under 2026-10-04.

> **RIGHTS — settled 2026-10-06. The music's licence is no longer an open
> item.**
>
> Suno's Help Center, *"Does Suno own the music I make?"*
> (<https://help.suno.com/en/articles/2416769>), puts the test in one sentence

>
> > If you were subscribed with a Pro or Premier plan when the song was
> > created, you are considered the owner of the song. […] If you are using the
> > free version of Suno (our Basic tier), we retain ownership of the songs you
> > generate, but you are allowed to use those songs for non-commercial
> > purposes, subject to your compliance with Suno's Terms of Service.
>
> **Ownership turns on the plan at CREATION time, not on how the file was
> later obtained.** These tracks were generated on 2026-10-01 on the free Basic
> tier, with no Pro or Premier subscription at any point. The single-download

>
> **So:** Suno retains ownership of `MUS-B-02`; the permitted use is
> **personal and non-commercial**, which a graded course submission is, and the
> loop in this repository is inside that grant.
>
> **The limits, stated rather than left to be inferred:** this project must not
> be sold, monetised or commercially released while that track is in it. A film
> of it posted publicly and unmonetised is still non-commercial use; a
> monetised upload would not be.
>
> **Scope of what was checked:** the Help Center article above, read
> 2026-10-06. **The Terms of Service themselves were not read in full** and the
> pack's receipt was not located. Nothing above rests on either.
>
> What was already settled: eight tracks generated on 2026-10-01, every one
> auditioned in the browser, and **zero** downloaded on the free tier. The free
> allowance was reported exhausted because Suno moved to seven lifetime
> downloads on 2026-09-03 and applied it retroactively, so downloads made on
> this account long before this course count against it. The paywall was **not
> circumvented** and nothing was screen-recorded.

### The character sprites — `CHAR-REF-01` and eight poses

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | **GPT-6**, as I reported it — an instruction-following image model rather than a diffusion UI, which is why its instruction was written as prose with hard requirements instead of comma-separated tags. Recorded as reported; I did not verify the version string myself. |
| Seed | **none exposed.** Same gap as the music: these reproduce as a request, not as an output |
| Licence | **TO CONFIRM — the last open provenance question in this project.** `ASSET-LOG.md` records it in the same place it records that the art broke this project's own seed requirement |
| Sources | `design/character/CHAR-REF-01.png` and `CHAR-P1` … `CHAR-P8.png`, 1254 × 1254 each |
| In the project | `godot/assets/poses/p1-idle.png` … `p8-death.png`, 32 × 32 |

The eight poses were generated from `CHAR-REF-01` supplied back as a reference
image, one request each, with the same opening sentence every time and a single
pose line appended. Full prompts, per-pose measurements and the reasoning are
in `ASSET-LOG.md`.

**Before this worked, four generations on Civitai did not**, and all four are
logged with what each failed on, three with screenshots of the generator's own
history in `design/rejected/`. Those screenshots corrected three facts I had
recorded wrongly, and the correction is left standing above the text it
corrects.

**Two edits are applied to every pose** by `scripts/import_pose.py`, and they
are edits to generated assets rather than properties of the generation:

1. **The directional rim.** The reference came back with a near-black outline,
   which snaps to `shade` at 1.14:1 against the dungeon wall — nothing at all.
   The importer adds 1 px of `steel_edge` toward the back and up. At real game
   size this takes the fraction of the figure reading at 3:1 or better against
   the wall from **6.3 % to 24.2 %**; the code-drawn character measures 9.1 %
   on the same test.
2. **Restoring the visor through the downscale.** The slit is 1–2 px tall at a
   28 px figure height, an area resample averages it into the navy helm and the
   result snaps to `plate`: **0 visor pixels in seven of the first eight
   imports.** 6–9 px restored per pose.

What the model produced is a slit in a 1254 px image. What the importer does is
keep it alive at 28.

### Nothing else is generated

**The dungeon, the HUD, the enemies, the traps and the blade are not
generated.** See section 2. No environment asset was generated, and the three
optional poses (air jump, attack recovery, celebrate) were not either.

**No sound effect has been generated.** See section 4.

---

## 4. Placeholders

Each is a documented stand-in that keeps the slice runnable and the test suite
honestly green. `godot/assets/README.md` lists them with a "Generated?" column.

| File | What it actually is | Replaced by | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|---|
| `godot/assets/death-laugh.ogg` | **3.42 s of silence**, `ffmpeg anullsrc` | a generated sound | Assignment 1's laugh was third-party with no documented permission. 3.42 s is deliberate: `test_game.gd`'s `enemy-death-reuses-the-reaction` reads the reaction's remaining time, so a stand-in of the same length keeps that assertion passing instead of weakening it |
| `godot/assets/death-laugh-cat.png` | a flat colour card reading PLACEHOLDER | generated art, or the reaction is cut | same rights problem |
| `godot/assets/sfx-jump.ogg` | 0.110 s, synthesised | a generated effect | see below |
| `godot/assets/sfx-slash.ogg` | 0.140 s, synthesised | a generated effect | " |
| `godot/assets/sfx-trap.ogg` | 0.260 s rising inharmonic metallic sweep, synthesised | a generated effect | " |
| `godot/assets/sfx-death.ogg` | 0.450 s, synthesised | a generated effect | " |

**The four effects are original but not generated, and they do not satisfy the
assignment's "generate sound" requirement.** They exist because `CONCEPT.md`
revision 1.1 predicted on 2026-10-01 that a 124 bpm bed with pulsing bass would
mask the trap's 15-frame warning, and that check is perceptual — it cannot be
automated **and it cannot be run against silence**. With them in place the
check runs now and runs again against the generated versions, comparable
instead of sequential. Replacement is file-for-file: no trigger, assertion,
level or balance changes.

| SHA-256 of the committed encodes | |
|---|---|
| `sfx-jump.ogg` | `fb8988a0ad17181289c1d4eaeeabdfcadece9bcf689cd26fbaa02fabf76ac4e0` |
| `sfx-slash.ogg` | `48133c472fd2120b1028c4c5597d73dd38739ad0ca8e5d627db07e84e3fa919c` |
| `sfx-trap.ogg` | `06d6218290628e4061fdbf77256f9814ff6232d6d121d4cf6c1663409399697f` |
| `sfx-death.ogg` | `37ba2eb0fe913792e1a902053cfeb11e65c6292ee03798c33d59f064dae46f73` |

Re-running the synthesis script reproduces the **WAVs** byte for byte. It does
**not** reproduce the OGGs byte for byte, because an Ogg page header carries a
stream serial number ffmpeg picks at random with no flag to pin it. The decoded
PCM of two runs matches byte for byte — checked, not assumed, with the commands
in the script's docstring. So the hashes above fingerprint one particular
encode rather than the sound.

## 5. Third-party screenshots of my own accounts

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `design/rejected/2026-10-01-suno-library.png` | a screenshot of **my own** Suno workspace, listing all eight generated tracks with their prompts, durations and model tags. Included as evidence because it is Suno's record of what was actually sent, which beats my summary of it — and it is why the log had to be corrected from "two generations" to eight |

No other screenshot of a third-party product is in this repository.

## 6. Fonts

**`ThemeDB.fallback_font`** — Godot's own built-in font, used for every string
the game draws. No font file is bundled, downloaded, or redistributed.

---

## 7. Tools

| Tool | Version | Licence | What it did here |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Godot Engine** | 4.7.2.stable.official.`ed1daf0bf` | MIT | the game, the test runner, the captures |
| **Python** | 3.12.10 | PSF | the build and check scripts |
| numpy | 2.5.3 | BSD-3 | tempo analysis, loop scoring, sound synthesis |
| scipy | 1.18.1 | BSD-3 | STFT, filtering, WAV I/O |
| Pillow | 10.4.0 | MIT-CMU | cropping the storyboard sheet, the contact sheet, the pixel checks |
| **ffmpeg** | 9.0.1-full_build (gyan.dev) | LGPL/GPL | decoding the mp3, encoding Vorbis |
| **Suno** | `v6-mini` | see the open item in section 3 | the music |
| **Claude (Anthropic)** | Claude Code | — | pair-programming throughout; attribution is per-commit in `Co-Authored-By` trailers and per-decision in `FRICTIONAL.md`, which records for each entry what was mine and what was Claude's |

---

## 8. What a reader should check first

1. **The one open provenance question**: the licence terms of the model that
   generated the art, in section 3. Everything else is settled.
2. `ASSET-LOG.md`, which has the full per-asset history including every
   rejection and two corrections that are left standing above the text they
   correct.
3. `godot/assets/README.md`, which is the shortest honest answer to "which of
   these did you actually generate".
